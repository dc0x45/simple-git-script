# Yeah, I wrote this!

This repo is for a script that adds, commits, and pushes your code.

It can be useful when your in a rush, pushing constantly, or simply don't feel
like typing out commands.

# Current version 1.1
This version works by just copying the script to any directory that Git is
initiated and executing it. It does not include itself in the push as long as
you only use the script to push your code. Either that or just don't add this
file to any manual pushes.

# Version 1.0

This version is the initial script that accepts the working directory by making
you edit the script itself. Named 'theOGscript.sh'
